The VectorNav Support Library is a community supported C-based API that is designed to communicate with products (particularly the VN-100) developed by VectorNav Technologies.
It is freely available to the public, and it's licensed under the LGPLv3.

VectorNav supplies their own SPI library interface. It can be found at: http://www.vectornav.com/downloads

Please take a look at the documentation to learn how to use the library in your own programs.

We have also included a sample test program called vntest.c
